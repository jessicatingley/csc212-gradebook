# Review Project - CSC 212 Gradebook

## Summary
### Project Description:
We have created a gradebook application to interpret course grades into categorical totals and final semester grades. The output will include a course grade calculated based on all possible points that can be earned within the course. The program will evaluate individual deliverables from CSC 212 and provide an accurate output of grading schemes based on the user request.

### Project Structure:
The application utilizes 3 classes - Individual, Category, and Course to perform the neccessary functionality.

The Individual class is used to return the name and grade of an individual deliverable from the course. The necessary command line arguments for utilizing the Individual class will be input as follows:
    <input file name> <class type> <assignment category> <assignment name>
  
The Category class is used to return all grades from the given category and the category total. The necessary command line arguments for utilizing the Category class will be input as follows:
    <input file name> <class type> <grade category> <output command>
  
The Course class is used to return each of the following: 
  - All grades within their respective categories and the course overall
  - Only category totals and the course overall
  - Only the course overall
The necessary command line arguments for utilizing the Course class will be input as follows:
    <input file name> <class type> <grade category> <output command>
